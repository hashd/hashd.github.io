> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute - Hal Abelson

Programmers commit a lot of sins wrt writing code on a regular basis but perhaps none of them is worse than writing ill-formatted code. Ill-formatted code not only makes the code look ugly but also makes it tough for anyone to follow and adds more stress to a person trying to understand the piece of code. It is like asking a person to aim for a bullseye in a game of dart on a wobbly surface, making his difficult task much more difficult.

Formatting and spellings to me is such a big deal that I have rejected potential candidates at my workplace for the same reason. I personally do not want to work with ill-formatted code and code with typos all over.
