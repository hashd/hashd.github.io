Hi, I'm Kiran. A Computer Science Grad from IIIT, Hyderabad currently working as a Software Development Engineer for Imaginea, BU of Pramati Technologies after having worked for more than 2 years with Dell IT GDC.

Focus of work so far has been around Data Integration, Management and Visualization which are key to businesses as they scale up. Apart from working, I spend my time exploring open source technologies, software and linux distributions. I blog, I play, I code, I listen, I read, I explore.

On a social note,

- I am a big foodie who loves eating a wide variety of food and am always on a lookout for new dishes.
- I love to travel, go on treks, go on an adventure every now and there. There was a time when I used to be travelling every alternate weekend but things have calmed down.
- I like playing outdoor sports, badminton and tennis being my favorites.
- I have an interest in photography, which I inherit from my Dad.
